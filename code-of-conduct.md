  #COMMUNITY GUIDELINES#

  ###Be excellent to each other.###
  Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.

  ###Speak up if you see or hear something.###
  Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

  ###Practice saying "Yes and" to each other.###
  Build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.
